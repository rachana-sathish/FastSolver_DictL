# Linear Neural Network as a Fast Solver for Dictionary Learning

This repository contains codes for reproducing the results presented in the paper titled "Linear Neural Network as a Fast Solver for Dictionary Learning".

After cloning or downloading the repository, download and compile the MATLAB toolboxes for [K-SVD](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/Software/ksvdbox13.zip) and [OMP](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/Software/ompbox10.zip). Instructions for compiling the toolboxes are available in the readme files of the correspoding toolboxes. ([Source](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/software.html))
